- ✅ **Error handling** - Comprehensive error responses

## 🚀 Quick Deploy Options

### Option 1: Docker (Recommended)
```bash
# Build and run in production mode
docker-compose up --build -d

# Check logs
docker-compose logs -f app
```

### Option 2: Node.js (Manual)
```bash
# Install dependencies and build
npm run install:all
npm run build

# Start in production mode
npm run start:prod
```

### Option 3: PowerShell Script (Windows)
```powershell
# Build and run in production
.\scripts\deploy.ps1 -Production -Build
```

## 🌐 Access Your Application

After deployment, your application will be available at:
- **Production URL**: `http://localhost:5000` (serves both API and React app)
- **Health Check**: `http://localhost:5000/api/health`

## 📝 Environment Configuration

### Production Environment Variables (`.env.production`)
```env
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=5000
DB_PATH=/app/data/database.sqlite
JWT_SECRET=your-secure-production-jwt-secret-key-here
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://yourdomain.com,https://www.yourdomain.com
```

### Client Environment Variables (`client/.env.production`)
```env
REACT_APP_API_URL=/api
```

## 🛡️ Security Features Active in Production

1. **Helmet.js Security Headers**
   - XSS Protection
   - Content Security Policy
   - Frame Options
   - HSTS

2. **Rate Limiting**
   - 100 requests per 15 minutes per IP
   - Configurable limits
   - Excludes health checks

3. **CORS Protection**
   - Configurable allowed origins
   - Credentials support

4. **Input Validation**
   - Express-validator for API endpoints
   - Client-side and server-side validation

## 🎯 Key Features Fixed

### ✅ 404 Error Resolution
The main issue you were facing (404 errors during deployment) has been resolved by:

1. **SPA Fallback Route**: Express now serves the React app's `index.html` for all non-API routes
2. **Static File Serving**: Production build assets are properly served
3. **Environment-based API URLs**: Client uses relative URLs in production
4. **Proper Build Process**: React app builds correctly for production deployment

### ✅ Production Optimizations
- Gzip compression for all responses
- Optimized React build with code splitting
- Efficient static file serving
- Request/Response logging
- Database connection pooling

## 🔍 Testing Your Production Deployment

1. **Start the application**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

2. **Test the health check**:
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:5000/api/health
   ```

3. **Test the API**:
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:5000/api/customers
   ```

4. **Test the frontend**:
   - Open `http://localhost:5000` in your browser
   - Navigate through different pages to test SPA routing
   - Try creating, editing, and deleting customers

## 🚨 Important Notes

1. **Change JWT Secret**: Update the JWT_SECRET in production environment
2. **Update CORS Origins**: Set your actual domain in ALLOWED_ORIGINS
3. **SSL in Production**: Use HTTPS in production with a reverse proxy
4. **Database Location**: In production, database is stored in `/app/data/database.sqlite`
5. **Backup Strategy**: Set up automated backups using the provided scripts

## 📞 Support & Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

1. **Check the logs**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose logs -f app
   ```

2. **Verify health check**:
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:5000/api/health
   ```

3. **Common solutions**:
   - Restart the container: `docker-compose restart`
   - Rebuild: `docker-compose up --build --force-recreate`
   - Check environment variables in `.env.production`
